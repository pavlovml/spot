Fast R-CNN config system.

This file specifies default config options for Fast R-CNN. You should not
change values in this file. Instead, you should write a config file (in yaml)
and use cfg_from_file(yaml_file) to load it and override the default options.

Most tools in $ROOT/tools take a --cfg option to specify an override file.
    - See tools/{train,test}_net.py for example code that uses cfg_from_file()
    - See experiments/cfgs/*.yml for example YAML config override files
